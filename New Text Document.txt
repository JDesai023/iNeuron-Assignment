for Q3.
(non root user)
i performed  $ mv file2.txt /home
Error: Permission denied.

I tried -f same error,
net I tried $ mv file2.txt ~/home

it moved the file to home but with name "home"

- why was it denying the permission in no root user.


(root user)
it performed the $ mv file2.txt easily.
